# Code

This file contains all the code for the noise-harbor-seals repository. 

----------------------

### Descriptions of different code files

- `Cleaned_seal_count_code.R`: This contains the code for exploring the seal count data, fitting it with a GLMM using brms, and conducting model comparisions.
- `Cleaned_surface_timings_bayesian.R`: This contains the code for exploring the seal surfacing duration (often used interchangeably with surface timings) data, fitting it with a GLMM using brms, and conducting model comparisons.
- `Cleaned_bham_current_data_extraction.R`: This contains the code for extracting the needed current velocity values from netCDF files provided by the LiveOcean model and then running a primary component analysis to arrive at the velocity compenent along the major axis of the decomposition.
