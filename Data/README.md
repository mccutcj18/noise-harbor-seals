### Descriptions of the data files

- `bellingham_bay_2023.06.01_2024.02.26.nc`: This contains the LiveOcean model's output from 05/31/2023 to 02/26/2024.
- `bellingham_bay_2024.02.26_2024.06.08.nc`: This contains the LiveOcean model's output from 02/26/2024 to 06/08/2024.
- `datetime.csv`: This is a list of all the observation dates and times that I matched up with the PCA output data to extract just the values I needed. 
- `full_current_data.csv`: This is a list of depth-averaged velocity output and the extracted PC1 values for each date and time from 05/31/2023 to 06/08/2024.
- `full_data`: This is a list of the dates, times, averaged in-air noise, count, observation ID, seal presence, water current (PC1), and averaged surfacing duration (avgsurfacetime). There are several other variables in the list but those stated in the previous sentence are the ones used in the analysis.
